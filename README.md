2) Face Dataset 
- Created a human face generator for making virtual avatars.
- Utilized using a GANs model with the CelebA database of faces as a data source.
- Successfully completed generator, discriminator, model and training.

Further Work:
1. Would have split female and male faces as the faces were muddled. 
2. Remove Jewelry as it was causing artifacting around the faces.
3. Play around with run parameters ie. changed 2d convolution to maxpooling, increase cycles, etc.
